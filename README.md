# AI-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System-NIDS-

A deep learning-based Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that classifies network traffic as normal or malicious using Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs).

🔍 Features
✅ Preprocessed NSL-KDD dataset for intrusion detection
✅ Deep learning model built using PyTorch
✅ Binary classification (Normal vs. Attack)
✅ Optimized training with Dropout & Batch Normalization
✅ Performance evaluation using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, ROC-AUC

📜 Dataset
This project uses the NSL-KDD dataset, a benchmark for network intrusion detection.
